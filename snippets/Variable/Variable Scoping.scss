Not all engines work with the same variable scoping mechanism. 
Actually, some don’t have variable scoping at all, which means all variables live in the same global environment (and can overlap). 
Some engines do have the new variable scoping system, where a variable is restricted to its scope (function, mixin…) 
if it’s not set with the !global flag.

This can be detected with:
feature-exists("global-variable-shadowing") == true
