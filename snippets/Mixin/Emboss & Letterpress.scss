1.Emboss

Although the design world seems to be slowly moving away from pseudo-realism thanks to Microsoft’s Metro UI (who would’ve thought!), 
shadows and highlights are still very useful tools for web and UI design.

The only problem is that CSS shadows are clumsy. 
Compass does take away some of the pain of using them thanks to its box-shadow mixin, but we can do even better.

It won’t take you long browsing Dribbble to realize that 90% of shadows and highlights are the same type: 
semi-transparent one-pixel lines placed above and below an element to give the illusion it’s embossed in its parent.

// Mixin
@mixin box-emboss($opacity, $opacity2){
    box-shadow:white($opacity) 0 1px 0, inset black($opacity2) 0 1px 0;
}


// Example
.box{
    @include box-emboss(0.8, 0.05);
}


2.Letterpress

Similarly, another common effect is the “letterpress” style, where the same “embossing” effect is applied to text. 
The thin white line not only simulates letterpress printing, 
but also makes the text more readable by providing a sharper separation between the letters and their background:

// Mixin
@mixin letterpress($opacity){
    text-shadow:white($opacity) 0 1px 0;
}
